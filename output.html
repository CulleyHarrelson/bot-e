I look either very unhappy, or downright evil, depending on one’s interpretation. Friends have had to assure other people that I won’t bite their heads off if approached! My husband is in the military, so every few years I have to start over from scratch with my social life, and it isn’t easy when I look so unapproachable. What can I do? I can’t walk around with a big, fake smile plastered on my face. It’s exhausting and I’d probably look a little looney!</td>

I talked to him about the outright bigotry his family embraces, and he is both embarrassed and also nonapologetic—I shouldn’t judge them for, amongst other things, referring to our president in a manner that you wouldn’t even publish.

Over the course of the 2.5 years he’s become very frustrated. I tell him to go find a woman or a man who enjoys ass as much as he does and play with them. We are in an open relationship, after all. He claims he has no time to date anyone else. We are at a crossroad in our relationship. He’s suggesting that I play with his ass or we go our separate ways.

I’ve been told by my friends and family that I’m wonderful and beautiful. I was even asked to be a model for a magazine, so I know I can’t be that terrible to look at. Yet no one seems to want me. To make matters worse, my &lt;em&gt;younger&lt;/em&gt; sister not only has a boyfriend she’s in love with, but has lost her virginity with him as well. (I’m still a virgin.) I love my sister and would never begrudge her any happiness, but I feel depressed for myself. Is it normal for someone my age to have never had a boyfriend and to still be a virgin? And where are all the good men? What can a girl do to get a boyfriend? —Young and Lonely Dear Young,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;There is no need for you to feel out of it. It is not unheard of to be 19 and to have never had a real boyfriend. It is admirable that you are still a virgin, considering you’ve never really cared for anyone. As to your third question, the good men are everywhere. (Well, OK, maybe not everywhere, but they’re around.) As for the fourth question, tone down the stress level about this issue. Live your life, follow your interests, enjoy your friends, and out of the blue will come a man who thinks you’re wonderful.  —Prudie, optimistically</td>

      <td>I’ve never admitted this to anyone: The idea of committing suicide turns me on sexually. I recognize how crazy that is, and I want to emphasize that I’m not suicidal. I’m not depressed, I love living, and despite this sexual impulse, I don’t want to kill myself. I’m turned on by the fantasy of hanging myself, but that’s not really how I want my life to end. (To be clear: Autoerotic asphyxiation gets a lot of press, but that’s not the situation here. Asphyxiation itself isn’t my kink, and other methods of committing suicide also turn me on.) My question is this: Given that I don’t want these fantasy scenarios to ever become reality, should I indulge the fantasy through healthy, safe play with a responsible partner or should I try to repress it and shut it down? I’m worried that if I indulge the fantasies through safe scenarios, I might reach a point where the safety precautions interfere with the thrill. On the other hand, I know that trying to repress sexual desires is a hopeless endeavor and trying to keep these fantasies in check might result in a scenario where they boil over and I end up engaging in riskier behavior than I would have otherwise.</td>

Last week one of the neighbors, “Michelle,” knocked on my door and told me that “Joan,” an elderly woman who lives two houses away, has cancer. Michelle said she and the other neighbors are going to be taking turns bringing meals for Joan once a week for the next three months. She said I had an option of either Wednesday or Friday and asked me to confirm which of the two I wanted. I politely replied that I often eat out and would be unable to commit to a weekly cooking schedule—besides, my cooking skills were terrible and I would feel embarrassed cooking for someone else. Michelle was upset and offended and continued to use emotional blackmail. In the end I told her I would think about it to get her off my porch. It’s terrible that Joan has cancer but I do not know her very well, and I don’t really want to do this. If my neighbors don’t want to look after me if I fall ill, I’m fine with that. Am I an awful person because I don’t want to bring weekly meals for a woman I barely know?</td>

So relationship sex can get boring quickly. I know there’s not necessarily a good answer for why, but any suggestions on what to do about this? I want to have great sex with a partner for life! Maybe my expectations about good sex in a long-term relationship are unrealistic? I know it’s not always going to be crazy passion, but how can I sustain amazing sex in a relationship?</td>

      <td>I would appreciate your take on a family situation. My husband and I have invited his siblings and their families to a party at our house over a holiday weekend. His family doesn’t live near us, so they will be in town for a few days. My husband’s ex-wife is quite put out with me for not inviting her to this party, or to a similar one we had last year for the same group. She maintains that his family was hers, too, for almost 30 years, and that she should be invited to anything that we have that involves them so she can visit and catch up with them. My husband’s children are all adults, and last year they came to the gathering and also made arrangements to visit their mother along with their dad’s family elsewhere. So my question is: Am I the bad guy here by not including the ex in the party at our house? I’m not especially fond of the woman, for various reasons, but she seems to think that I have an obligation to allow her to see her ex’s family at my house. —Thank You!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Elisabeth X Dear El,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;It is Prudie’s great pleasure to tell you that, in this situation, the current wife rules. You are not a bad person to choose not to include the first Mrs. X in family gatherings. She is, after all, not part of YOUR family. (For certain occasions, of course—like weddings—you are stuck.) Your husband’s kids did it just right last year when they arranged a separate gathering. And if the ex wants to “visit and catch up,” she could always host her own gathering. Prudie is not saying that a longtime ex should be cut loose from people who were her in-laws for years, just that the current wife is by no means obligated to entertain her. As you no doubt know, there are some “extended” families where the exes are great friends … but yours is not one of them. And for what it’s worth, Prudie would rather roll around in a clothes dryer than socialize with her husband’s ex.  —Prudie, customarily</td>

Now she wants me to disinvite him and tell him the truth about why. She says she doesn’t want his grief to ruin her happy day. I take full responsibility for being insensitive in not asking her permission first, but how in the world can I disinvite him without hurting her feelings?</td>

We have the same interests and views and make each other laugh all day. We’re both around 30. We are also interracial, from very different backgrounds: I’m Caucasian, from a Catholic family; he’s South Asian, from a Muslim family. A few years ago, he denounced his conservative lifestyle and became nonreligious but has kept this from his family, who live in a different state. If his parents knew he stopped practicing Islam, or that he drank, or that he was dating me, they would be appalled and cut him off indefinitely. So, he says that he can never tell them about me. Which means that if we move in together, it would have to be somewhat of a secret, and if we got married, we couldn’t publicly celebrate it. I don’t know where to go from here. Is there some sort of compromise that I haven’t thought of? I’m willing to work with this, but the thought of being a permanent secret is not something I’m enthusiastic about.</td>

Perhaps this fellow is, like me, a connoisseur of intellectual dishonesty. Although I must admit that I prefer the site of the Communist Party of the United States (from which, if one knew nothing else, one would conclude that Marxism-Leninism is a vital force in contemporary American social and political life) to Holocaust-denial sites. But to each his own. The best thing about the Internet is that by visiting sites containing hateful things, you wind up costing the person or group that sponsors the site money. This is much better than when you had to buy their literature to see it and actually give them money. Imagine getting everyone with Internet access to visit some hate-filled site and then the slug who runs the thing getting a huge bill from his Internet provider.

My friend recently told me that if her second-born is a girl, she would like to give her the same name as my daughter. Though, rationally, I know I have no claim of exclusivity on my daughter’s name, my friend’s intention irritates me. Am I wrong to think that this is a breach of unspoken baby-naming etiquette among family and good friends? Does such etiquette really exist? If so, what would be a diplomatic way to object? Would it be sneaky to involve an intermediary to point out the unspoken rule? —Knocked Up and Bent Out of Shape Dear Knocked Up,&lt;br/&gt;I understand your irritation, and there’s one thing you can do about it: nothing. You acknowledge you have no special claim on this name, so let it go. Try to turn your thinking around and see this as a flattering tribute to your taste and your daughter’s lovely personality (no one chooses a name they associate with someone they don’t like). If your friend ultimately uses the same name, on the occasions you are all together, your daughter will likely be thrilled to be known as “Big Edna” while the baby is “Little Edna.” And there’s a 50-50 chance she’ll have a boy and all this will be moot. —Prudie</td>

And the third consecutive night was our first date. In that first text conversation, he stated that he is into “everything from mild to wild.” The comment came without solicitation from me, during a conversation that he initiated about sexual preferences (e.g., top or bottom, dom or sub). This was a major turn-on for me, increasing my interest in him. I’ve had limited experience with BDSM, but I am looking to try more, so I was thrilled to receive this message. I am very familiar with one kink: diapers. It’s a huge part of my sexual identity, and I ideally want it to be part of a sex life with my partner. Normally I would wait until months into a new relationship to bring up the topic, but since he opened the door, should I talk about it now? Should I drop hints to see how he responds? Since this has the potential to be more than just a hookup, what’s the best way to proceed?</td>

      <td>I’m an American who not long ago got a job in Bahrain in an industry hard-hit at home by the recession. My wife and children are still in the United States. I was getting ready to move them here but now wonder whether it would be the right thing. It was wonderful to see the peaceful Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. But things here have been less than thrilling. The police and military have cracked down on protests and are arresting activists. Even if half the reports are true, the government is engaging in behavior I find atrocious. But here I am, in a job that doesn’t oppress anyone, minding my own business. Occasionally, I have to drive through a police checkpoint, and sometimes there are tanks on the street. However, I have heard of no violence against Americans. I like my job, and I think it will provide for a great future for my kids. But is it ethical for me to bring my family here? Is moving them here tacitly supporting the regime?  —For Freedom Dear Freedom,&lt;br/&gt;When I watched the foreign nationals leaving Libya for their own safety after the people began their uprising to topple the dictator Muammar Qaddafi, I didn’t feel that their presence as employees of global companies meant they personally supported the reigning lunatic. Individuals should weigh what it means to them to work in countries that lack freedom and oppress their people in myriad ways. But China and Saudi Arabia, for example, both have appalling human rights records as well as vigorous economic activity with the United States, and few would conclude the foreigners employed there are tacitly endorsing those governments. There may be regimes so repellent, and dangerous, that you’d never consider working there or bringing your family. But right now, the United States has a &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2073178,00.html"&gt;complicated relationship&lt;/a&gt; with Bahrain—after all, it hosts our Navy’s &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fifth_Fleet"&gt;Fifth Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. It’s admirable that you are grappling with these issues, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t continue your work or consider having your family join you. Before you bring your wife and children, have a serious discussion with your company’s security division and find out their plan in case Americans need to be evacuated. You should also contact the consular office at the U.S. Embassy. They offer such services as the &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/ui/"&gt;Smart Traveler Enrollment Program&lt;/a&gt;, which alerts Americans abroad of dangerous conditions in the host country. Then, if you conclude the right choice is to all be together, let your children know they will be embarking on a great adventure.  —Prudie</td>

      <td>I got married last spring to a wonderful man who loves me, my three grown children, my grandson, and the rest of my family. My children and family members all love my husband, too. My husband was previously married for more than 30 years. His ex ended the marriage 10 years ago because she was involved with and eventually married another man. The breakup was hard for my husband and his grown children to accept. When we announced our intention to marry last year, his grown daughter told him that she will never attempt to have any relationship with my children. She has also refused overtures from my youngest daughter to spend any time together, even though they have children of the same age. She told her father that she is still too upset over the breakup of her parents’ marriage and is not ready to “take on another family.” Recently, we went to deliver gifts to her children, along with my mentally handicapped son. When we arrived, she only spoke directly to my husband and refused to look at or acknowledge me or my son! My son recognized that he was not welcome and went to sit in the car. His feelings were hurt, and my feelings were hurt for him. Is it too much to expect that this young woman would accept my children as part of my husband’s family now that we are married? I am completely stumped as to how to handle this situation. —Apprehensive Stepmother Dear Apprehensive,&lt;br/&gt;It’s possible your stepdaughter may have an undiagnosed &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/personality-disorders/DS00562"&gt;personality disorder&lt;/a&gt;. The woman’s rudeness is of such a magnitude that there’s got to be something wrong with her, and it’s hard to believe this is the one area of her life where she acts in such an outrageous manner. If so, don’t expect much to change, which doesn’t mean you should put up with her behavior, no matter what the cause. No, it’s not too much to ask that she accept your children as part of her father’s family—they are part of her family since they are now her stepsiblings. That she explains her refusal to make eye contact with you or your son because she is still in mourning over the death a decade ago of her parents’ marriage would be laughable if it weren’t so infuriating. Normally, I tell second wives to back off interfering with their husbands’ relationships with their children from a previous marriage, but in this case you need to ask your husband if he will have a serious talk with his daughter. Ideally, he would tell her that he has been lucky to find love again and that he expects her to behave with common decency to her new family members. If she says she can’t, he has to explain he is very sad to hear it, because by necessity it is going to reduce the amount of time he will be able to spend with her.  —Prudie</td>

      <td>My husband is an automotive technician and recently started a new job with a repair chain. His problem is that his boss is always giving the technicians’ labor away as a form of Christian charity. It seems that every customer has some sob story—a death in the family, divorce, unemployment, a fixed income—that prompts the store manager to give that customer free parts and/or labor. Though my husband works hard all day, some days he is only paid for two hours of work. He has protested to his manager, but all he gets are sermons. The district manager is a great fan of my husband, but my husband is afraid if he complains to the D.M., he’ll get the store manager fired because the D.M. would be eager to find out why that store earns so little profit while processing so many cars. Should my husband speak up about his good Samaritan boss?  —The Reluctant Philanthropist’s Wife Dear Reluctant,&lt;br/&gt;Your husband’s manager should open his own shop; maybe he could call it Take Me For a Ride Car Repair. There are many people in need, and it is a worthy goal to fix cars for those who &lt;em&gt;truly &lt;/em&gt;can’t afford it. So the boss should do this on his own time, possibly through his church. What this Samaritan is now doing is stealing from his employers. If he keeps this up, he will only add to the unemployment rolls when the district manager catches on and fires everybody who has been giving away valuable parts and labor. Your husband should tell the D.M. what’s going on, and if the manager won’t stop, he should be bounced. As 1 Peter 4:8 says, charity may cover a multitude of sins, but in this case it shouldn’t cover a new transmission.  —Prudie</td>

Often, these co-workers leave at 4:30 or 5 on the dot to pick up their kids or attend their events, leaving me to stay late (up to several hours) to finish up work that needs to be done. It’s frustrating—just because I don’t have kids doesn’t mean I don’t have a life outside of work.

Because I plan to remain child-free, at least for the foreseeable future, this is less than encouraging advice! How can I draw boundaries in this situation without seeming unreasonable? I love my job otherwise, and these people are all genuinely nice—they just seem to have a blind spot when it comes to this issue.</td>

I’m very insecure, so I feel like part of the reason this has been going on for so long is because I’ve never had someone so attractive be into me.

We (her friends) understand her pain and feelings of confusion, loss, and anger. We each, and as a group, try to be supportive and helpful. But it’s been six months! As one of our group asked, “Is this break-up going to last as long as the relationship?” We’re pretty much tired of talking about the ex, what might have been, how it happened, etc. It’s just tears and recriminations with no seeming effort on her part to, well, get over it. This may seem a selfish question, but how do we get over it? Or is it our tolerance and friendship that are lacking? This break-up has become an all-consuming topic within our group. And it’s not pretty.</td>

I said goodbye to my amazing fiancé with tears in my eyes even though I was only going to be gone for six days. We’re in our late 20s, have been together for four years and have always had a strong, loving relationship. When I reached my friend’s apartment, I met her roommate “Josh” who turned my world upside down. I have never given another man a second look during my relationship, but Josh and I had such an instant connection, it was unsettling. We spent hours talking, sharing stories, and getting to know each other’s backgrounds. While my fiancé and I have lots in common, there are issues that we have compromised on (number of children, religion, saving vs. spending). Josh and I, however, seemed to be in sync on every issue we addressed. Nothing physical happened, but I left the trip feeling sad that I was leaving Josh! I am absolutely dumbfounded by these feelings. I obviously don’t know Josh well enough to know that we would work out as a couple, but he introduced a doubt in my relationship that I can’t seem to shake. I still love my fiancé, but now I’m questioning if our foundation is strong enough for a marriage … which is supposed to happen in six months! What should I do?</td>

I haven’t asked her for anything in regard to this, and her comments make me feel like my brother’s wedding was more important than mine.</td>

Her ex-husband does not know how serious the verbal abuse has become or how much has occurred in front of their kids. I don’t know if my friend has told her kids not to reveal to their dad how their stepdad treats her, but for some reason, they don’t say anything to him.

I’ve found them after he hides them in his closet, which also serves as a general storage area. After discussions with him, I’m certain that wearing them is a pleasure thing for him. (He says “curiosity,” but this has been going on so long that he knows what it feels like.) He has even stolen some of the neighbor girl’s Baby Alive doll diapers to wear and soil. We’ve told him he has to stop stealing diapers—from our neighbor, because stealing is wrong, and from us, because these things are flippin’ expensive. We are pretty grossed out by it, despite being pretty open-minded people. I may be more grossed out by the prospect of piles of dirty diapers hidden somewhere in the house, but the thought of purposely peeing your pants isn’t pleasant, either. I believe we have a fetish growing here, and I don’t think a parent needs to be involved in it, but he’s stinking up the joint.</td>

We have explored and enjoyed each other for a decade now, and we recently started exploring BDSM and D/s fantasies. Everything was going great sexually—until last night. Two years ago, my wife expressed an interest in an MMF three-way, where I was the Dom guiding the action between all three of us. I planned this event, play by play, reviewing in my mind everything that was to take place. There were many conversations about expectations, stipulations, etc. All bases covered, I went into the event mentally prepared and gleefully excited. Magic happened for about two hours—passion, love, and dirty, dirty sex. Almost every kinky kind was being had and enjoyed save vaginal intercourse.\nThen my wife was vaginally penetrated by our friend.\nIt was as if all the air in the room was sucked out through my soul. I instantly lost my bone, gone forever (I thought), and I felt angry and nauseated. I had to stop the scene. My friend and my wife instantly tended to me during my breakdown. The sorrow of disappointing my wife hurts the most, even though she calls me brave for this. I don’t feel brave. I feel confused. I had planned how everything was going to happen. I even gave the fucking command (literally) for my friend to enter my wife. Crushing emotional pain followed.\nIn the morning, my wife woke me and made love to me, tenderly and healingly. So at least the dick works. I am still beset by all manner of doubts and insecurities. Is my dick big enough? Am I good enough for her sexually?\nI feel scared and trapped in a land that I have never visited before, a land called Insecurity.</td>

I was so in love with him, but he split up with me and broke my heart. He found a new girlfriend and married her after we graduated. They had a child and moved out of state. At first, he contacted me through a classmate-finder Web site, and we chatted online several times. Eventually, he said he would be in my area and would love to see me. When we met and hugged, the emotions came flooding back. He felt so good in my arms, and his smell was the same as I remembered. We talked for hours. Since then, we have been e-mailing, texting, and talking on the phone. We are both still married, but I can’t stop thinking about him. We want to get together so badly. I love my husband very much, but I can’t let go of what I feel for my first love. I think maybe I never really let go of him; I’d just locked all of those emotions inside, thinking that’s all I would ever have left of him.

However, my husband still wants her and tells me that he will leave me someday for her. I am crushed and very unhappy.

Over the years, we carefully brought some members of her birth family back into her life with the help of a great therapist. They now see her one to two times a year and speak to her regularly. They haven’t always made the best choices for themselves, but we never denigrate them. However, she is now saying she’s no longer interested in speaking to or seeing most of them. She just says, “I live here, and I’m happy.” We are committed to a healthy, well-managed open adoption because we feel it is in her best interest. Do I force the issue with visits and calls? Any suggestions on a compromise? —Torn Dear Torn,&lt;br/&gt;Your daughter knows she was adopted, and she has some memories of what must have been a painful start to her life, but she is telling you that what she wants at this point is to simply be a member of your family, not the wonderful girl who was taken in from foster care. You have obviously handled all this with great sensitivity for everyone concerned, but your primary consideration has to be your daughter’s feelings. If it is a burden for her to be constantly pulled back into the life she left, then that should take precedence over your desire to manage the openness of her adoption. She may—or may not—want to explore this part of her heritage more as she gets older. You’ve made those connections for her, and she knows she can renew them if she changes her mind. But to force her now to see people she doesn’t want to see could undermine her sense that she is simply part of your family, without an asterisk attached. Tell her you understand how she feels, will respect that, and will also help her if she wants to resume contact. Then tell the family members that you will send them periodic updates about your daughter’s life, but as she’s becoming a very busy teenager, you’re going to take a break from the get-togethers.  —Prudie</td>

      <td>I’m a 20-year-old lesbian who recently started dating an 18-year-old friend I’ve known for years. The problem: She isn’t out of the closet yet to her (very conservative) mother. She’s planning a dramatic coming-out at her high-school graduation party, and she wants me to be there so she can introduce me to pretty much her entire extended family as her girlfriend. The situation seems to be engineered for maximum emotional bloodshed. I’ve tried talking her into breaking the news about her sexuality to her mother more privately, and on a less important occasion, but she is determined. My question, then, is this: How likely is my presence to make the situation worse? I want to be there as my girlfriend’s emotional support, but I’m afraid of being cast by her mother as the Evil Older Woman who seduced her child into a Sinful Lifestyle—something that would undoubtedly (knowing my girlfriend) turn into a huge and possibly irreparable fight in front of all her relatives. &lt;font size='2'&gt;Of course, if I’m not there, the fight may occur anyway—but I’d prefer my presence not be the reason her family disowns her.&lt;/font&gt; What should I do—accede to my girlfriend’s wishes and be there as emotional support and Exhibit A for her homosexuality, or let her go it alone in hopes that the explosion will be smaller? Thanks very much for your help. —Last Straw? Dear Last,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Guess what? If you’re not there, Prudie doesn’t think the graduate will announce anything. You sound very emotionally smart about all this, for which you are to be complimented. Your pal’s plan for the knock-out punch to her mother reeks of hostility … not unlike (true story) the man who, at his 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; wedding anniversary black tie dinner, announced—with dessert—that he’d been unhappy for a long time and was leaving his wife. Perhaps give your lady love a choice: You will be with her at her graduation party with there being NO announcement, or if she is dead-set on coming out then, you will not be present. Offer to join her and her mother the next day for a discussion. If you can’t get through to her, explain that your good judgment is telling you that an announcement of homosexuality is not something to be sprung on a room full of celebrating relatives and to call you when it’s over. —Prudie, judiciously</td>

      <td>I’ve been married for 19 years and we have three sons together—two in college and one just starting high school. I started a relationship with another woman about nine months ago that was supposed to be just a one-time thing, but we fell in love (I know I’ve always had a thing for women). I’ve known her for three years. She has two wonderful daughters and is out as a lesbian. My sons all know their father and I are planning to get divorced. Of course they want us to work it out, but I’m in love with this woman. We connect like I never have with anyone else. I’m also in counseling and have been for six months. I’m scared to come out to my children because I’m afraid I will lose them forever. I love my sons, but I’m torn because I want to be with this woman for real. She isn’t pressuring me to come out or to introduce her to my kids or the rest of my family and friends; she says when the time is right I’ll know. She’s been so patient and accepts me as I am. My children have told me that whoever their father or I date, they will treat that person horribly and “chase them away.” I know they’re just hurt about the separation, but I don’t want to lose my girlfriend. What can I do? —Torn</td>

      <td>I am a 38-year-old widower. Three years ago, my wife passed away after a long illness. Our son was not quite 4. Since her death, my focus has been exclusively on him and my work. I have had no social life. My mother-in-law helps out, but she is quite old. I recently hired a woman to take care of my son until I get home from work. The woman is 24 years old, and my son adores her. She has a boyfriend of several years who seems like a good guy. Here’s the “problem.” She just told me she has a serious crush on me and is restless in her relationship. She has also made feints into discussions about sex with me, which I’ve brushed away. She is very attractive, and I have been completely alone since my wife passed, so this is pretty awesome on about 100 levels. But, of course, there are also a number of complications. I will not do anything if she is still seeing her boyfriend. If she does break up with him, what are my options? I pay this woman to watch my son. Does that arrangement end if I begin seeing her? If we eventually break up, can I (gulp!) hire her back? Do I sound as creepy as I feel? —Lonely Dad Dear Lonely,&lt;br/&gt;If your name is Von Trapp and hers is Maria, that would color my answer. But before you two burst into a chorus of “My Favorite Things,” I’m afraid pursuing this young woman, awesome though it may sound, is a bad idea on about 100 levels. It is perfectly understandable that you are eager to fall into bed with her; it’s about time you felt alive enough to pursue another woman. Since you’re already wondering whether you can hire her back when things don’t work out (answer: no), you clearly aren’t interested in her as more than a jumpstart to your too-long-dormant sexuality. Hooray that your sap is running again. So use the motivation she’s provided you to start looking for someone more suitable to date. This young woman has a pre-existing condition: She’s your son’s baby sitter. Both you and your son have been lonely and in pain since the terrible death of your wife. But he’s now made an emotional connection to this young woman, and it would be unnecessarily confusing for him to lose her as a baby sitter because you started an affair with her. I applaud that your response to her feints has been to brush them off and not to ravish her. Since nothing’s happened yet, keep it that way. You need to tell her that you appreciate the wonderful job she’s doing with your boy, and you want her to continue, but you two must leave your relationship strictly as employer and employee. If she can’t accept that, then you have to let her go. And now that you’re ready, you must put out the word with your friends—who have surely been waiting—that you’re in the market. —Prudie  &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://slatev.com/video/dear-prudence-breaking-my-hairdresser/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;</td>

Should they or I confront Q directly? Should we let it go, but not invite him anymore? (Eventually, he would catch on.)

Listen to what he has to say in response, but since you believe he did it, let him know you’re not bluffing and that the group’s ban is irrevocable.

I don’t mind hosting every once in a while, but I feel that if I don’t put something together, we won’t see each other. I know for a fact that the weeks I don’t pull a meal together, my friends just sit alone in their respective apartments and feel sorry for themselves. I think that’s incredibly dumb. Couple this with the fact that I dislike hosting (it’s expensive and stressful, I dislike cooking, and I’m an introvert who needs breaks from people), and resentment is starting to build in an unhealthy way.

      <td>My best friend since college died suddenly. Prior to her death we had talked about my getting custody of her children in the event of such an occurrence. She was a single mother by choice and fortunately could afford to do it. I have been with her from Day 1 and have watched her babies grow up and consider them to be as much mine as hers. She had been estranged from her family for many years so there was never any question as to who would care for them if she was unable. Some months before the accident I became engaged but now that there are kids in the picture he has put the brakes on the engagement. He always seemed to like children, and had expressed interest in having a family, but now he is saying that he isn’t sure he wants the responsibility of taking on a pair of grieving 5-year-olds. I am naturally very hurt but agreed that if he doesn’t feel he can commit to being a father then we cannot be married. How do I explain to people who are expecting me to be getting married in the next nine months that it is no longer happening without going into all the details of our life?</td>

      <td>My husband (42-year-old straight male) and I (38-year-old bi female) have had a closed relationship so far, but we have an active fantasy life. We’ve been together for about four years, and we both had our fair share of partners (casual and serious) before that. We like to talk about fantasies involving other people during sex, be they actual (past partners) or imagined (my beautiful surfing instructor on a trip). Once while he ate my pussy, I asked him about all the pussies he’s enjoyed in the past and he brought up one of his exes—a relationship that ended 10 years before we met—and he said he sometimes thought about her when he went down on and/or fucked subsequent partners, including me. This turned me on. A lot. I started bringing her up every now and then while we fucked, I asked him more about her, and I fantasized about meeting her and eating the pussy he enjoyed so much. Like other past partners, she became part of the mental/verbal porn reel we sometimes enjoy during sex.\nThen one day, in an unrelated conversation, it came out that he had been engaged to her, that the reason they broke up was because they couldn’t make a long-distance relationship work after he moved to the country where we live, and that it took him years to get over her. This killed it for me. Not only that, but I also now feel weird about all of the times we fantasized about her in the past. It’s not like he did anything wrong—I never specifically asked how serious the relationship was or why it ended—but I can’t shake the irrational feeling there was an omission. I sometimes think about past experiences during masturbation or sex, but never about serious partners—never about men I’ve lived with, been married to, or had a child with. Those experiences are too emotionally loaded to mix in with my current sex life in a healthy, detached way. I know my husband may process/feel things differently, but I can’t help but equate what he was doing to me fantasizing about my ex-husband during sex, which I haven’t done and would feel weird as fuck even contemplating. I don’t see her as a threat—they’re not in touch and she lives in another hemisphere—and I believe him when he says he has no significant baggage about any of his exes, including her. But knowing she was one of the most significant relationships in his life makes fantasizing about her—out loud, with me—feel “off.” I don’t just have this feeling just about her now, but about his past overall. How do I shake this? Thoughts? —Turned On Turns Into Turnoff</td>

Instead, she was only interested in sex that directly pleasured her. She didn’t think about my pleasure while I satisfied her with cunnilingus or helped her to masturbate herself. After six months, I was losing interest, so I asked her why it was like this. After that talk, I had to leave for work, and after a month, we met again.

      <td>I recently married a wonderful man and have encountered quite a quandary. Prior to the wedding, I made a sincere effort to establish a relationship with his parents, a seemingly “white picket fence” couple. As I got to know his mother, however, she would have several glasses of wine during dinners with just the two of us and discuss how unhappy she was in her marriage. I always tried to steer the conversation elsewhere on these occasions and began to see less and less of her for fear she might confess to the affair I suspected she was having, and I would be obligated to tell my fiance. During one of our wedding showers, she had a few too many and pulled some of my family to the side to tell them she had been in love with another man for 10 years and wanted to leave her husband. Aside from the sheer inappropriateness of her actions, I was left wondering what to do—she didn’t confess it to me, but I still know about it. She takes “trips” with her friend nearly every weekend, and always wants to pull me aside when my husband and I visit to tell me the latest reason she’s unhappy with her marriage. I want to get along with her, but I cannot put myself in the position of being her ally. To be honest, it’s so obvious to me that she’s having an affair that I can’t figure out why my husband—or hers—doesn’t know. When it all comes crashing down, I don’t want to be in the middle. My allegiance lies with my husband, but I don’t want to make a rookie mistake by telling him what she’s divulged to my family and to me. Do I spill the beans or keep this to myself? —In the Middle Dear In,&lt;br/&gt;The wild card here is that Prudie believes, generally, that husbands and wives not keep secrets from each other. In your case, however, she will make an exception. Chances are that both husbands—yours and hers—know about her unhappiness, her booze problem, and her stepping out. For some people, it is less painful to play dumb. And if neither man knows, so much the better. Do not interject yourself into this sad tale unless asked. (You can only wind up in the middle if you put yourself there.) And you’ve learned an interesting life lesson about the seeming “white picket fence couples,” wouldn’t you agree? —Prudie, reticently</td>

      <td>I have a bit of a dilemma that has left me puzzled. I recently had drunken sex with a longtime friend of the past five years. What started out as us spending the day having drinks with a group of friends turned into us having emotional, drunken sex in her bed. Prudie, this girl is my best friend, and we talk/text/message all day throughout our workday. The problem is while I am very much mentally attracted to her, I don’t necessarily know if the physical attraction is there, and she feels the same way. She really understands me, as a man, very well, and I her. The question is can this work as a relationship? Can you be so mentally attracted to someone, but not necessarily physically attracted to them, and have a successful relationship? I feel like if I don’t give it a shot with her, I’ll never find someone who is so compatible with me personality-wise.</td>

Politely, I said thanks, but no thanks. Since then I have received several notes from my mentor ordering me to “apologize” to the H.R. director for being “ungrateful” and to apply for the other job.

But anyway, for about the last year our “personal” life has slowed down quite a bit, which I admit is my fault. I just don’t have the drive and desire I used to. (I’m only in my mid-20s.) When we do spend time together, he is very touchy-feely, and it drives me absolutely crazy. I try telling him nicely that I don’t mind being close, but everyone needs some space, and I don’t like being felt up all the time. Sometimes I feel like a cat that is being mauled by a small child. What can I do to increase my desire in the bedroom? And what can I say to him that will make him back off the constant groping without being harsh? Every time I bring this up he gets upset with me. I do love him, it’s just the physical attraction has gone out the window. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. —Feeling Like a Mauled Cat Dear Feel,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Prudie’s gut reaction is that your drive and desire has not dissipated, but rather this chap has started to annoy you. Picking on some bit of behavior is usually a red herring for some deeper, underlying unease. It is usually the case, when a young couple is in love (and engaged, no less), that the snuggly, touchy-feely closeness is a delight, not an irritant. Did the “groping” get on your nerves in the beginning? It is most likely that the physical attraction is tied to the emotional commitment, and something is out of whack. Good luck sorting things out. —Prudie, causally</td>

Light or not, I am black, and resent any implication that I should be proud that I do not “look black.” I usually respond, “Blacks are both light and dark, so I do look black.” I’m not sure the people who make these comments realize it is insulting, and sometimes I want to say, “You don’t look white to me,” as many whites look like my family and we are all black.

We run the gamut.’ Then leave it at that. Or you could elaborate: ‘My whole family is black and everyone is a different color. It’s very common.’ Personally, I like the second option.

More than anything I think she wants to feel appreciated by our scattered family—both my sister and my father spend most of their time at least a six-hour plane ride away from our family home. I live in an adjacent city. This year we took a family trip to a destination of her choice a few weeks before her birthday as a celebration of a milestone year. She had a good time on a trip, and a few days after our return I gave my mother a few small, personal gifts and my best wishes. On her actual birthday, I was admittedly rushed and not thinking, so I didn’t contact her until I got out of work. She ignored all of my calls and text messages. The next day she notified me that she has nothing to say to me and has resisted any attempt to contact her since. Through my sister I know that she’s upset that I waited until later in the day to call and also that my father got her a thoughtless present she’ll never use—all of which, combined with her usual birthday malaise, have triggered a mompocalyptic rage that I don’t know how to defuse. I feel like it’s all my fault for not trying harder. When my mother gets like this, I get stuck on the image of her being upset and alone while my father and sister are away, and know that she relies on me to feel appreciated. The guilt is unbearable.

If he weren’t my stepbrother, I would definitely ask him out, but I see that there are infinite potential problems here. First off, if we break up it will be insanely awkward, but it’s also kind of weird and incestuous. (On the flip side, we’ve barely known each other five years, so he’s not REALLY like my brother.) Prudie, please tell me not to date my stepbrother so I don’t keep thinking about it!</td>

      <td>I’ve got a question I doubt you’ve ever gotten before. It has a bit of everything: sex-work etiquette, long-distance phone interaction, and a het cis chick anxious not to lose her tolerance badge. Here it goes: A few months ago, I started getting hang-up calls from numbers I didn’t recognize in Boston. Then weird texts started showing up, trying to set up “dates.” I responded to the first few because I figured someone was giving out a fake number that just happened to be mine. (I kept my cell phone when I moved from Boston to Seattle.) But after the fourth or fifth call/text from a different unknown number, I turned to the Internet. Google informed me that my phone number is identical, except for area code, to a trans escort working in Boston. I’m getting one or two calls or texts per week meant for this other woman. They’ve started to get more explicit. Because of the time difference, they come at weird hours. I don’t know what I should do. I can ask my phone company to block each number individually, but that’s a pain in the ass. I can text the correct area code to the men who are writing to me looking for the trans escort, but I don’t really want to help people too stupid to read a phone number correctly. I suppose I could report the whole thing to the Boston police, but I doubt they’d care. I don’t have any moral objections to sex work, I just don’t want people to call/text me asking for it. Aside from changing my phone number, which has been my sole number for almost eight years, anything else you can suggest? —Stupid Phone And Messages</td>

Recently, my next-door neighbor sent an email about HOA business to everyone in our row of houses, and I discovered that she has me in her contact list under the alias “LOUD neighbor.” I’ve thought long and hard about whether it’s possible that I’m too loud. I do have two grade school–aged sons, but they are in bed by 8 p.m. We don’t play music. We don’t have a dog. We don’t bounce balls against the shared wall. We don’t have parties. We do not have loud domestic arguments. We’re noisy enough (in a normal way) that I’m sure “LOUD neighbor” is not meant to be an ironic label. This is a noisy neighborhood with a city bus stop and a bar across the street and a train several blocks away. There should be no expectation of absolute quiet. I’m concerned that the neighbor expects us to live our lives like the Frank family hiding from the Nazis and tiptoeing about on stocking feet lest we be discovered. When we first moved in, I introduced myself and said, “Let us know if we’re too noisy.” This isn’t how I meant for her to let us know. What do you think? Should I put her in my contacts as “UPTIGHT neighbor”? Should I confront her? Should I buy my sons a drum set?</td>

But he’s a smart, funny kid and after a few months we started actually liking each other. Not to get all mushy on you, but at some point that like turned to love. \n\nHere’s the problem: My boyfriend’s parents—who are a little younger than I am—were snooping around in his room and found video clips on his computer that clearly illustrated our activities. He still lives with his parents and they were, prior to this discovery, entirely ignorant of their son’s sexual orientation and sexual interests. They’re now threatening all the things asshole parents usually threaten: to kick him out, to stop paying for school, to disown him.\n\nHe’s stayed at my place many times and my first reaction was, “Come live with me, you don’t need that kind of crap in your life.” But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if it’s the right thing to do. They are his family. Would I really be acting in his best interests if I helped him walk away from them, even as horrible as they’re acting? I can put him up at my place. I can pay for his schooling. Heck, I’d be proud to do it. But I wonder if I’d be facilitating a decision he’d one day come to regret. Plus, we’re in Boston and he isn’t yet 21. On top of everything else, is there a chance the law could decide to bite me in the ass?</td>

My parents are doing a wonderful service to these children in providing them with a warm, loving home. However, as the oldest child, a lot of responsibility was put on me from ages 12 to 18 to babysit, watch, and care for my younger siblings. I never felt like I had much of an opportunity to be myself or build my own interests because the vast majority of my time was occupied caring for children. I am attending college on an academic scholarship and I am enjoying my studies and learning to grow on my own. I recently got a summer job near my university and there is an affordable apartment I can rent for the summer while I am working. When I told my parents, they got very upset, claiming that I was “abandoning” them. They said that they needed me home to drive children to appointments and provide summer care. I feel like I gave my teenage years to my family and college should be my opportunity to grow as an individual. My parents think family is more important than anything else and I owe it to them and my siblings to come how and offer care. Who is right in this scenario? If I decide to stay in college, how do I explain my choice to my parents and preserve a relationship with them? If I decide to go home, is it possible to negotiate for a few hours per week that I am not responsible for children to go to a movie, talk to a friend, or do some yoga?</td>

      <td>When I met “Ryan,” I knew he had a girlfriend because I met them both at the same time. From the moment I met Ryan, I could tell he was attracted to me, and though I was attracted to him, I put up a lot of barriers to make sure we never got closer than friends. He and I ended up developing a close friendship. We did art together, played music, and talked about just everything under the sun. I always invited his girlfriend to come along, but sometimes it was just the two of us. In an effort to create more barriers, I told Ryan a lot about my past heartbreak over men who were in relationships but actively pursued me without ever leaving their partners, and how I wasn’t interested in repeating the same mistakes again. To make a long story short, after a few months, Ryan ended up telling me he loved me and that he wanted to leave “Ashley.” I told him I loved him too, but that I wanted a type of love he couldn’t give me because he was in a relationship and I wanted to tumble, with no restrictions, madly in love. Ryan said that he wanted the same thing as me and told me that I was the woman he wanted to be with for the rest of his life. I trusted that, considering everything I had told him about my past, that he had listened to me when I told him exactly what I wanted. We started sending love letters to each other. We spent time together reading books out loud and going for aimless walks. We started being physically intimate. Ryan told me he didn’t want Ashley to know that he and I were in love because he wanted their breakup to just be about the problems that they had together and not to drag me into it. Ryan then got “confused” about what to do and repeatedly asked me to hold on to what we had, even though he hadn’t broken up with Ashley. This went on for six months. He continued to send me love letters. Ryan then decided, to my surprise, to stay with Ashley and cut things off with me. And he hasn’t told Ashley about any of this and says he plans to “wait until things get better” between them. I’ve cut Ryan completely out of my life because he knowingly brought me into a situation I explicitly told him I didn’t want. He has lied to me, his girlfriend, and himself. None of our friends know about what happened, and I feel like Ashley should know so that she’s not stuck in a relationship with a man who intentionally lied to her for almost a year (and continues to). Should I tell someone so they can tell her? I know hearing it from me would not be the best idea. I have no intentions of pursuing anything with Ryan in the future, so this is not an attempt to get her to break up with him so I can swoop in. I’m just wondering if this is a situation where I can perhaps share some information so Ashley can make her own decisions about what to do. —Failing Boundaries</td>

The girls come from some of the wealthiest families at the school, and since our family is more working class, we love that Bella is able to see how the other side lives and maybe even look for something to aspire to one day. So far Bella has had so much fun with all the girls. But last week I got a nasty email from one of the mothers. I sent some homemade cookies and store-bought veggies and dip for the snack last week, and apparently this was not up to snuff! The mothers said that my vegetables were clearly not homegrown and organic and that they could taste the pesticides and preservatives on them. They asked if I knew that ranch dip is high in cholesterol and saturated fat which leads to heart disease. I was in tears reading this email. Their assumption that I had no idea how to feed my daughter was so insulting. I emailed them back saying that I was unsure what particular brands of veggies, dip, and baking items to buy, and received another email suggesting I start a garden. Prudie, we live in an apartment complex. I am unsure how to respond. I really, really want my daughter to be happy and have friends with the right values and aspirations. But I have no idea how to make these women happy. I went to the farmers market an hour away last weekend to look for some appropriate items to send for next week, but the market was so expensive. I don’t want my daughter to get kicked out of this playgroup, especially now that she’s so happy. How can I handle these clean-food moms?</td>

I have two questions.\nNumber one question: I texted my sister the only date I wasn’t available in the next two years, which is Columbus Day weekend 2013. I have my 10-year college reunion, which I’ve been organizing. My sister texted me back that they picked this Columbus Day weekend for the wedding even though they have no idea if the places they want will be booked up. It quickly came out that they didn’t check with anyone about potential conflicts. She wants me to be the maid of honor, and I’m not sure what to do. She’s really upset with me. Columbus Day weekend is of no significance to them (it’s not the anniversary of the date they met or anything), and I can’t reschedule the reunion.\nNumber two question: I was born female but do not identify that way. I’m genderqueer and do not look like a girl. I have not worn a dress in 10 years and feel like I’m in drag in one. In the past, my sister said she would consider putting me in a pantsuit-ish kind of thing at her wedding, which would be great, but I am worried that now I’m rocking the boat too much with this Columbus Day thing and I don’t know if I should just leave it alone. My girlfriend, who is very pretty and feminine, said if I had to wear a dress, she’d go in a suit and bow tie.\nDan, help! If for some reason my sister can’t get her weekend, it will be because they’re rushing and everything is booked, but I have already caused trouble! Is it worth it to fight for the pantsuit thing, or should I just leave it alone and do what she wants?</td>

After a lifetime of therapists, specialized education, and other interventions, he is now a freshman in college far from home. His dad and I are paying for his tuition, room and board, and books. He was expected to use his summer job earnings for personal expenses. His lack of social skills makes him dependent on alcohol and cigarettes to form his social life, and that plus his immaturity (imagine sending your son to college at age 14) means he went through his money quickly. But he is still drinking and smoking and getting high. When he was home for his last break, I asked him how he affords to do this, and he wouldn’t tell me. You can imagine what went through my head. (Drug dealing?) I asked if it was safe and legal, and he said yes. After some snooping, I learned that he is using a webcam service for chats with men who offer “tips” for sexual viewing. I suppose this is technically safe and legal, but because I’m unfamiliar with the technology involved, I don’t know if he is putting himself at risk emotionally or if screenshots can be captured that can affect his future career, relationships, etc. I’m a longtime follower of your column, podcast, and books, and I hope that someday my son and I will be as close as you and your mother were.

      <td>I am an enlisted member of the U.S. military. My wife and I are friends with another military couple. My friend’s wife, “Betty,” recently got a job at a local retail shop. When we were over their house last weekend, Betty told my wife how everyone at her store robs the company blind. Later my wife was on a local listserv and noticed that Betty had an astonishing number of brand-new items from the store listed for sale. The reasons she gives in the ad for selling the items are pretty flimsy. Should we tell her husband of our suspicions? I don’t want to risk my friendship if he either doesn’t believe us or if these items are legitimately Betty’s to sell. Worse still, what if he knows about it? —Lost in the Woods Dear Lost,&lt;br/&gt;In these situations, the easiest thing to do is just let adults make their own (bad) decisions and watch them play out. And you’re under no obligation to inquire whether Betty is engaged in larceny. However, since Betty let your wife in on the fact that the store where she works is being systematically stripped of its inventory by the employees, then your wife found possible evidence that Betty couldn’t resist this cookie jar, your wife could say something to Betty if she’s comfortable doing that. She could tell Betty that she saw on the listserv the items Betty was selling and that it concerned her given Betty’s description of what goes on at the store. She should say that even if the store owner seems like an idiot, one day this person could call in the authorities. And if that happens, those who have been helping themselves to the merchandise are going to pay an exorbitant price for it. —Prudie &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dear-Prudence/103985625702"&gt;Become a fan of Prudie&lt;/a&gt; on the official Dear Prudence Facebook page.

My problem is with one man who wears a thong-style bathing suit. I’m not the bathing suit police, but now I’ve seen him walking around on several occasions with a very noticeable erection. The kids notice too, and make hushed jokes about “banana-man.” He doesn’t seem to pay any attention to the kids in the pool. He swims a few laps and gets out. Still, it makes me uncomfortable when he gets in the pool while my girls are swimming. Should I ask him to “lower the flag pole” before swimming with a bunch of kids? This does not seem like normal behavior, but I don’t want to overreact. Advice?</td>

As a result, some curiosities peeped their heads over the boundaries of my once happily repressed existence. I summoned the courage to join an online BDSM dating site. I got a response almost immediately from a man who decided to fill me in on how things worked. He proceeded to tell me my name would henceforth be Sub, advised me that he was to be addressed as His Majesty King Something, and ordered me to phone him. This was too much, too fast, and too weird. I gave him what I thought was a plausible excuse for my decision not to proceed to avoid hurting his feelings. He wouldn’t take no for an answer. I tried blocking him, but he seemed to have several identities on the same site. I deactivated my account.

      <td>You could tell your boyfriend the partial truth, DEHUMANE, or you could tell your boyfriend the whole truth. The partial truth would go something like this: “Guess what, honey? I shaved off all my body hair all by myself just for fun. Do you like it? And, hey, we’ve been dating for a while, so I should probably lay all my kink cards on the table.” Then you tell him about these fantasies—to be dehumanized, to be an object, to be helpless—and you do it with a smile on your face and a bone in your jock. Remember: You’re not sharing a tragic cancer diagnosis with him. You’re sharing something fun, interesting, and exciting about your sexuality. Don’t panic—and don’t hold it against him—if he reacts negatively at first. This is the start of a conversation, not the end of it, and it’s a conversation about his desires, too, DEHUMANE, not just yours. If it turns out that dehumanization/objectification isn’t something he can do, and it’s not something he could allow you to do with others, then you’re not right for each other. End the relationship and date kinksters you meet on Recon, and disclose your kinks earlier to any presumed-to-be-vanilla guys you date. (You never know: You could disclose your kink to a presumed-to-be-vanilla boyfriend and discover that he’s as kinky as or kinkier than you are.) The full truth would go something like this: Hand him this column. DEHUMANE’s boyfriend, if you’re reading this, please know that the mistake your boyfriend made—doing this behind your back in the hopes that one experience would satisfy his curiosity forever—is a common one. A lot of people, kinky and not, believe that kinky desires don’t work the same way vanilla desires do, i.e., unlike “normal” sexual desires (fucking, sucking, rimming), kinky desires (pissing, spanking, binding) only have to be acted on once. Do it once, get the kink out of your system, enjoy vanilla sex—and only vanilla sex—for the rest of your life. But kinks don’t work that way. In the same way that “normal” people don’t wanna fuck just once in their lives, a person with your boyfriend’s kinks isn’t going to wanna be objectified and dehumanized just once in his life. Your boyfriend didn’t know that before he did it the first time, but he knows it now. If you can find it in your heart to forgive him, you could wind up with a very hot and very grateful guy. Back to you, DEHUMANE: Put Recon Guy on hold until after you full or partial the boyfriend. If you do want to play with him again—because you’re single or because your boyfriend approves—have an out-of-roles conversation with him about what happened last time. He didn’t hurt you, he tricked you, and you’re understandably wary of playing with him again. If you do play with him again—a big if—this time anything you haven’t ruled in is automatically ruled out. No tricks. With any luck, your boyfriend, if he feels like he can trust you again, will be there to keep an eye on him and to enjoy the sight of your helpless, faceless body.</td>

Before we met, he was in a relationship with a terrible, alcoholic, and mentally unstable woman. They got pregnant early in the relationship and stayed together for about five years. We met a year after they broke up. I felt like I’d come to terms with the ugliness of his past, with his trying to stay in a bad relationship for the sake of his child and the rest of it. But recently, thanks to the vastness of the internet, I came across a suggestive photo of my boyfriend with his ex’s sister. I asked him about it, and he admitted to sleeping with her while he was with his ex. He says it was during a particularly bad period, he was very drunk, she made the first move, etc., but I’m just so grossed out. Cheating is one thing, but fucking your girlfriend’s sister? And it’s not like this was a 19-year-old’s mistake; he was near 30 and the father of a child. He also fudged a little about whether it was just one time or a few times. I feel like now I’m questioning his integrity. This is something that I wouldn’t have thought him capable of doing. What do I do?</td>

However, this included a double gravesite for the two of us, with his name, date of birth, and death, and my full name and date of birth on the tombstone.

I tend to tiptoe around this, but clearly they expect me to be buried there. However, my preference now is to be buried with my current husband. My first marriage was so short, and I am happier and more fulfilled in this one. My former in-laws are in their 70s, so in the ordinary course of things they should go first. But if that doesn’t happen, I don’t want to cause an ugly fight. Is stating my preference in my will sufficient?

I referred my friends to him and helped him grow his business. He eventually disclosed that he had developed feelings for me. I went into instant shock and said that I had no idea; I thought we were only growing in our friendship. He told me that he had to tell me and wanted to leave it up to me if I felt comfortable continuing to see him. I was really numb from my shock and thought I was OK at first, only later realizing how upset and violated I felt. I never went back to him. I found out that he closed his practice during COVID.

The final straw occurred yesterday when my husband answered the phone and she tried to convince him to call her behind my back when I am in labor.

      <td>When I was 8 years old, my aunt gave me her old dollhouse along with its furnishings. Although the actual dollhouse (already in bad shape when I received it) was thrown away by my parents, I saved the furniture, which I loved. When my own daughters were old enough, I gave it to them in a dollhouse I built. Shortly after completing the house, I sent a picture of it to my aunt, along with a letter thanking her again for giving it to me so long ago. To my surprise and dismay, she promptly asked for the furniture back. This really upset me because the furnishings were the only items saved fom my childhood toys. She is an aunt by marriage, who divorced my uncle long ago, and we were never particularly close. She has a reputation for being stingy, even though she is wealthy. I knew her main reason for wanting them was their value as antiques. I told her she would need to ask my daughters, then 8 and 10, because they now belonged to them. She didn’t ask, and I never mentioned this to my daughters. It’s now eight years later and yesterday she called my oldest daughter, now 18, to ask if she could have the furniture. My daughter told her the items had sentimental value and she would have to think about it, and ask her sister about it, as well. Are we under any obligation to return this furniture? —Wondering If I’m Stingy Dear Wondering,&lt;br/&gt;If she wants to demand the return of the things of value too hastily given away, I wonder why she’s harping on doll furniture. Step up to the big items, Auntie—petition your ex-husband to give you back your youth. No, neither you nor your daughters have an obligation to return gifts given freely decades ago. I would be tempted to just let this go—the woman seems to ask only about as often as we get a new chairman of the Federal Reserve. Or your daughters could close the matter by writing a note explaining that they, and you, have gotten great joy from this gift, and that they will continue to treasure these items and hope to pass them on to their children someday. —Prudie</td>

My friends actually do this all the time, but I don’t want to offend them by saying “No, not nice.” For instance, I will say, “I tripped when I was walking and I have a huge scrape on my leg,” and some friend would reply, “Nice …” and I want to say, “No! Not nice! I have a huge scrape on my leg and it hurts. Would you call that nice?” I think it is a rude, not very thoughtful thing to say. When people do say this to me, I figure that they have nothing else to say. I have even heard it on TV commercials and the radio, and it’s getting hard to deal with my little pet peeve. Any advice? —&lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; Nice Dear&lt;em&gt; Not&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;Um, the response “Nice” in the example you mention, is called irony. It’s been popular for quite a while, certainly since Socrates, and is often intended to be humorous. That is why you’re hearing it on TV and radio. Perhaps the best way to define the ironic response would be to say that it is the opposite of the expected reply … hence, irony. Of course none of your friends think it’s really nice that you tripped and hurt your leg. Prudie’s guess is that your friends think it’s cooler to show their sympathy by saying, “Nice,” rather than, “What a bummer, you’ve hurt your leg.”</td>

      <td>I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost a year, and we enjoy a great sex life. He really enjoys performing oral sex on me and does it frequently. I, on the other hand, really do not enjoy performing oral sex and never have. It makes me feel very uncomfortable and often elicits a gag reflex/panic response. He mentioned recently that he has accepted the fact that “I just don’t do” that particular act for him and that he’s OK with it because it’s harder for me to achieve orgasm than him and he prefers sex to oral sex. Still, I can’t help but feel guilty and that this is something I should force myself to be doing for him since he does it for me so often. Is there some kind of unspoken equality when it comes to oral sex? Should I feel obligated to do something in bed that I don’t enjoy to make things “equal” between us in this area?</td>

I get on perfectly well with the older grandchildren and even had a few live with us as they went to school in our city.

Her attitude is actually a joke between some friends and me. My family has acknowledged her behavior toward me, but their way to keep the peace is to tell me that since I’m the oldest, I need to be mature and ignore it.

However, I recently moved closer, and now the pressure is on to come home for the holidays. Prudie, I’m in my 30s and have discovered my best holidays have been spent with friends, food, beer, and bad horror movies. It’s not that I don’t want to go home; it’s just my desire not to deal with Crystal outweighs my desire to see my family. Last Christmas saw me emptying my brother’s liquor cabinet.

We set a date in the summer of 2010, but due to financial hardships, we had to postpone the wedding indefinitely. I was really disappointed but understood why it had to be done. When our financial situation got back to normal, I began asking my fiance if we could set a new date, but he was reluctant to do so. A few months later he admitted that he was scared, didn’t want to end up divorced again, and didn’t think he was quite ready. I was devastated, to say the least. He says he loves me with all his heart and doesn’t want to lose me, but I don’t see how I can just go back to the way things were before the proposal. But I love him, we have built a family (he has two children from his first marriage, I have two from mine, and we have one together), a home, and a good life together. I don’t know what to say when asked when the wedding is, or why I’m not wearing my ring anymore.

      <td>I have been seeing the most delightful man for eight months. We are together every day, and have dinner either at his house or mine every night. A month ago, he went with me to my home state for my daughter’s graduation. He’s the sort of person everyone likes and wants to be around. When we first started seeing each other, he made it very clear that he was not interested in a sexual relationship. He is 55 and I am 62. He is gorgeous and I am a little less than that! I want the relationship to move forward, but I do not know how to do this without becoming extremely vulnerable. It would crush me if I made the advance and he turned it down. He says he is impotent, and I believe that he truly believes he will never have sex again. Should I just force myself to forget it? I know he could do things that would help with erectile dysfunction, and we’ve talked about it. I never initiate those talks—he does, but he always drifts off to another subject very quickly, as if he can’t discuss it. I would go the rest of my life this way before I would humiliate him.  —Wanting a Touch Dear Wanting,&lt;br/&gt;Take your boyfriend by the hand (if he allows that much contact), sit him down, and tell him your feelings are such that you need to know what’s going on. Maybe he has been so embarrassed by impotence or has such a low sex drive that he gave up trying long ago. If so, there is a world of new treatments he could explore. Tell him you would be happy to look into this together. He might have nonstandard genitals; he could be a transsexual; possibly he’s gay; maybe he’s the 55-year-old virgin. Think through how you would react to any of these situations—you want to do him the favor of not appearing shocked. If he can’t say the words himself, ask about the above possibilities—it might be easier for him to say, “Yes, that’s it.” If he wants to keep things as they are, you have to decide if you can be happy in a platonic relationship now that you know the reason. Or you could reassure him you can accept physically whatever you uncover; there are many ways to sexually satisfy each other. But explain that it is too difficult for you to have such an emotional connection without better understanding why there’s no physical one. —Prudie</td>

      <td>A few months before my husband and I got married, I found out by accident that he wears a toupee. As we lay in bed one night, I noticed what looked like hairspray or gel buildup on his hairline. He was fast asleep, so I went to scratch it off, and what I thought was gel turned out to be the tape of his toupee! Here he had been wearing a toupee all this time, and I never had the faintest idea. I’m sure he’s painfully embarrassed about it, as he’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; particular about his appearance, but I’m his wife and hate knowing he’s keeping this from me. Do I somehow gently confront him about this? I’m nervous to do so, because I think he would be extremely embarrassed. In the end, I want him to know that I love him no matter what he looks like, and he shouldn’t feel like he has to wear a hairpiece. —Bald Is Beautiful Dear Bald,&lt;br/&gt;There’s better, there’s worse, then there’s Hair Club for Men—which may be worse than worse. If you scroll around the Web for Hair Club counter-testimonials, you’ll find the most astounding thing about your story is that when your courtship began, you didn’t immediately suspect that your future husband had a muskrat pelt attached to his scalp. A standard toupee is supposed to be removed nightly, but customers of the Hair Club, or an equivalent, have the wig taped and glued on for weeks at a time. (Though your husband’s hair follicles appear to be dead, let’s not think about the life forms that must be breeding under the rug.) When he disappears without explanation, he isn’t cheating on you; he’s at the club getting his muskrat adjusted. We live in a glorious time for male pattern baldness, a time when even men who still have hair flaunt fully shaved heads. What a service it would be if you could release your husband from the tyranny of the toupee so that his scalp can breathe free. But he sounds like a delicate vessel, so handle him gingerly. Tell him the truth—that one night as he slept you noticed a buildup of glue on his scalp and realized he was wearing a toupee. Say you know that he takes great pride in his appearance, but you’re sure he would look just as handsome—probably more so—if he went natural. It will probably take time for this advice to gel, but maybe one day he will be willing to flip his wig. —Prudie  &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://www.slatev.com/player.html?id=24059176001"&gt;&lt;em&gt;</td>

      <td>My husband and I met in college in an English class, and our first date was mostly a conversation about our favorite novels. One of my all-time favorite works is &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; by Vladimir Nabokov. I’m pregnant with my first child, and I want to name our daughter (it’s a girl!) Lolita. However, I’m worried that all the ties the name has with pornography and child molestation may outweigh the beauty of the name and significance the book has had in my life. My husband is ambivalent regarding the idea. What should we do? —&lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; Lover Dear Lover,&lt;br/&gt;It may be wonderful for your daughter, a couple of decades from now, for her literate (and I hope age-appropriate) lover to whisper, “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta.” But it will be less fun for her to have well-read adults do a double-take when she’s introduced or to hear the taunts when her high-school classmates get clued in and start quoting Nabokov. In the years immediately following the 1958 U.S. publication of this scandalous &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679723161/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0679723161"&gt;best-seller&lt;/a&gt;, the name Lolita had a small but sharp &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://www.babynamewizard.com/voyager#prefix=lolita&amp;ms=true&amp;sw=f&amp;exact=true"&gt;peak&lt;/a&gt; of popularity. Then parents must have realized they were naming their sweet little darlings after a pedophile’s object of desire, and &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; precipitously dropped off the charts, never to return. It’s true that the memoir &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081297106X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=081297106X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading Lolita in Tehran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has given the name an air of freedom against tyranny. But not enough to overcome the sexual connotations. If you went with Lolita, your daughter would be unique in a sea of Sophias and Emmas, but I’m not sure in the long run she’d thank you for it. You and your husband should go through the canon of books that brought you together and find a female character with a less problematic story. If you want to tip your hat to Nabokov, &lt;a data-linktype="External" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375755349/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0375755349"&gt;Vera&lt;/a&gt;, his wife and creative partner, might be a good alternative. But if you can’t let go of Lolita, make it your little one’s middle name.  —Prudie</td>

When Ryan was home for Easter he talked to my husband and me and requested we get somebody to watch Amy at his college graduation. We said we would think about it and have been unable to make a decision. On one hand, Amy can be very difficult to handle in crowds and has a hard time empathizing with others and giving them the attention they might want or need. There are also only two tickets for handicap accessible seating, which means my family would not be able to sit together during the ceremony. Ryan was 6 when Amy was born and he has always been loving and compassionate toward her, so I think this stems from a desire to have this event be about him, not about all the logistics that surround a handicapped person. On the other hand, I am afraid that this will set a terrible precedent. What other events will Amy be excluded from, weddings, funerals, our 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; wedding anniversary party? How would we explain this to Amy, who is very sensitive? My husband and I would appreciate any guidance you have.</td>

It suddenly occurred to the bride that she missed out on an opportunity to receive some nice wedding presents. She conned her doting grandparents into hosting and paying for a “wedding” with the white dress, seven bridesmaids, and a barbecue for 100 expected guests. I wouldn’t have had a problem had it been billed as a wedding reception, but the invitations were the schmaltzy “you are invited to celebrate the beginning of Jack &amp; Jill’s life together” and included business cards from the merchants where she was registered for gifts. One of the cards even had a dollar figure on it as a minimum gift amount. I declined the invitation, even after the bride’s grandmother threatened never to speak to me again if I didn’t attend. I’m all for marital bliss, but not as a fundraiser, and announcing that you won’t be my friend if I don’t come to your party is a little too much like junior high school for me. Am I being picky? —Ticked Dear Tic,&lt;br/&gt;Even with a thesaurus, Prudie is having trouble coming up with a word to apply to a minimum dollar amount written on a merchant’s business card enclosed in a party invitation. (We will not even deal with an almost certainly immature bride and the groom’s alma mater, as it were.) The odds are good that you are not the only one to look askance at this charade, and that Granny will be threatening quite a few others on the guest list. —Prudie, indefensibly</td>

We talked about this, and she wants to stay scarred and boobless. I respect her wishes. It’s her body…so no plastic surgery. But I get weirded out instead of excited every time I see her nude.

      <td>I’ve had a close male friend that I’ve been secretly in love with for years. We have almost always lived in different cities and frankly, our lifestyles are fairly different to the point that I had all but discarded the idea that we could ever be in a romantic relationship. Aside from a fun weeklong fling over a decade ago, we’ve always kept it platonic, mostly because one of us was always dating someone in the couple of times a year we’d see each other. Flash forward to this year when I told him my boyfriend and I were getting married. He seemed shocked, but happy for me, came out to help me prepare for the big day and was an all-around champ. After the wedding I talked to my new mother-in-law and was shocked to find out that he referred to me as “the one who got away” in his own life. What? I never went anywhere and he never said anything! I used to tell my girlfriends that he was the one I’d run away with if he ever expressed any interest. Now, two days after my wedding I’m stuck with this thought that we’ve been mutually and silently in love with each other for years. How did I get stuck in a bad rom-com script? And why would he say that to my new MIL of all people. (She looked at me pointedly when she told me about it later.) BTW, I love my husband dearly and we have a lovely life together. I’m not interested in leaving, nor do I regret any decision I’ve made. Mostly I wonder how I go on knowing there was a possibility for that other life I always dreamed of but never believed in. Do I ever say anything to him about this?</td>

She has been fired from all of the positions she has had for the past three or four years for conflict between employees or directly insulting her superiors. After struggling to find a job for several months, she told me that she applied for a job at my company, specifically within my office, which is midsize. It is not that I fear conflict between the two of us, but I fear that her behavior with other co-workers will reflect poorly upon me. Any guidance on navigating this sticky situation? Should I assume the HR department will weed her out in the screening process, or do I need to take matters into my own hands?

We both feel slightly uncomfortable with me knowing such personal things about her without meeting her, but we don’t want to limit the intensely open communication we have earned with each other.

Every girl we’ve dated has ended up hurt because our relationship with each other is always more important than she is. I worry this girl will be devastated when he doesn’t leave me for her. Should he squelch all the romance now? She’s had a rough few years, and he doesn’t want to add to her problems. On the other hand, he’s the first person she has been able to connect with in a long time. And should he even consider bringing her into our relationship?

My iPad died while I was home and my mother told me to look in the kitchen drawers for a charger. I couldn’t find one there, so she told me to check my brother’s bedside table. I opened the drawer and, with a little digging, found a charger.\nI also found a few pictures of gay porn and a couple of pictures of male celebrities with their shirts off that had been clipped from magazines. It isn’t the gay porn I have a problem with. I fully support him coming into his sexuality, whatever it might be. But then I found a few things that were a bit more disturbing: I found a picture of our father in his swim trunks, and another one of a fully naked man with a cutout photo of my father’s face glued over the original model’s face. Needless to say, I was freaked out. I put everything back where I had found it, including the charger, and haven’t said anything to him about it. Now I’m in a tough spot. I know that telling my brother I found the pictures would mortify him, and I feel like telling my father would be a complete dick move.\nAny help you can offer me would be a big help. —Concerned And Scared</td>

      <td>I work in an office tower in downtown Seattle. From time to time, I go to a bathroom on a mostly deserted floor, go into a stall, and rub out a quick one. Usually, no one comes in. Today, just as I was blowing a load into a handful of TP, someone came into the bathroom. This person walked up to the stall and stared through the door crack. This person stood there for a second before walking over to the urinal. He finished and left. I flushed and washed my hands and left. A security guard came around the corner while I was waiting for the elevator. He rode the elevator down with me but said nothing. At the lobby, I got in the elevator that takes me back to my floor. As the door closed, I heard someone say, “See that guy?” I am paranoid that security is going to confront me. But have I done anything illegal? I may have exercised poor judgment and been squicky, but is it illegal to masturbate in a closed bathroom stall on private property?</td>

      <td>My boyfriend and I are currently doing the long-distance thing, as I’m finishing up some schooling. About two months ago during some dirty phone talk he said he’d been masturbating while thinking about me fucking another man while he watches. This was unexpected. In the past, I screwed around on boyfriends. He knows this, but I thought he also understood that I only want to be with him and that I am not interested in additional male partners. He brings this scenario up whenever we’re having phone sex or we’re together and he’s aroused. When he’s not hard, he says that the thought of my being with another guy is gut wrenching and awful, but when he is aroused, he tells me that he really wants me to do this. I’m confused. Previously, partners have brought up unexpected stuff in bed and I’ve rolled with it (bondage, strap-ons, etc.), but they were always able to talk about it later—what it was about, why it was a turn-on, etc. My current man gets upset when I try to talk about it outside of sex. Are you familiar with this sort of drastic, disgusted, after-the-fact denial?</td>

      <td>I’m a 42-year-old single, straight female who recently started dating a 36-year-old man in a somewhat exclusive, long-distance relationship. We have known each other for a short time, but have clocked hours upon hours on the phone. I have specifically stated many times I don’t want kids of my own (he does), am extremely safety conscious (only when I see someone’s STI results and know we’re 100 percent monogamous will I go “bareback”), and am against hormonal contraception. Therefore, I’ve insisted on the use of condoms since our very first encounter, which he at first reluctantly agreed to, but has since obliged without incident. He is expressively into me and treats me better than any guy I’ve dated; cooks for me, gives me massages, buys me gifts, showers me with compliments, listens to me at any hour of the night, and has shown nothing but respect towards me since Day 1. Until our last sexual encounter. He woke me up in the morning clearly aroused and ready for sexy time. He asked if he could enter me, and after I said yes, I grabbed a condom for him and he put it on. We were spooning at the time so he entered me from behind. At one point early in the encounter, I reached back to grab his hand, and all of a sudden, felt the condom he had been wearing laid out on the bed. Shocked and outraged, I immediately stopped and turned to him asking, “Why did you take this off?” To which he replied, “Because I wanted to cum faster.” All I could muster back was, “Do you have any idea how bad that is? I can’t even look at you.” I covered my eyes and cried uncontrollably for a few minutes. After getting dressed, showering, and exiting without a word, I started to process the atrocity of his actions. It’s clear that he does not respect me, my body, my health, or my reproductive choices, and made his physical pleasure as top priority. He has apologized profusely, been emotional about his actions, and has definite remorse. After sending him several articles on how it’s criminal (including the one about the German man who got eight months in jail for stealthing), he now seems to grasp the severity. It’s hard to reconcile his consistent respect for me with a bold and disrespectful act like this. The best case is that he’s a dumbass, the worst being that his respect and care for me is all a façade and I’ve been a fool. Is there any reason I should consider continuing to see this guy? Is it remotely forgivable?</td>

      <td>My wedding is 59 days away, and I am concerned about my future mother-in-law’s dress. She is a wonderful woman who makes me feel accepted as her son’s choice for a wife. But with only two months left before the wedding, she had finally begun her search for a dress. Last Sunday, my mother-in-law held my bridal shower at her house. My mother told me that while she was there, she saw a photo of the dress my mother-in-law picked out. She described it as “young, low-cut, and flowing.” I wanted to get to the bottom of this, as my mother-in-law had not even informed me that she had purchased anything. So, after the party, I sent her an e-mail, and she sent me a picture of the dress. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. My 51-year-old mother-in-law has picked out a dress with a wispy skirt, a V-neck, and spaghetti straps. It’s fit and styled for someone my age—25! And it’s robin’s egg blue—which doesn’t even go with my champagne-colored dress, the bridesmaids’ sage green, the chocolate brown tuxes, and my mother’s pale pink dress. I can’t swallow the fact that she would attempt such a daring wardrobe choice on a day so important to me and her son. This dress has been ordered and is not set to arrive until two weeks before our wedding! I really need advice on how to tell her that I do not feel it is appropriate to wear.  —Frustrated Bride Dear Frustrated,&lt;br/&gt;The nerve of this 51-year-old woman to decide she’s just going to march off and buy a dress that she finds flattering without asking permission of a 25-year-old. Sure, she has welcomed you into her family and thrown a shower for you. But now she has really shown her true colors—robin’s egg blue, to be exact—by pulling this spaghetti-strap stunt. This V-neck desecration has to be stopped! You simply must tell her the hard truth. Something along the lines of, “Hey, you old hag, no one wants to see your saggy flesh. Your choice of color is an outrage. And, in case you’ve forgotten, in 59 days it’s going to be my day, my day, my day, my day.”  —Prudie</td>

Some days I want to contact the kid (his info is on the police report); other days I pray that I can learn to forgive him. My mom is expected to make a full recovery (although pain may be an ongoing issue), but she won’t walk for six-to-eight weeks and will have to go through therapy for longer than that. How do I let go of this anger? The accident could have been a lot worse, so I am thankful that my mom is just suffering from broken bones.</td>

It worries me that they didn’t think ahead about her fear before getting the pet and that they refuse to put my daughter above it. They will probably be reasonable about the guardianship and babysitting as no longer working for me, but where does that leave my family? Am I being unreasonable, or are they being unkind? My little girl’s fear isn’t a matter of just not being used to animals. She is utterly terrified just seeing the puppy at the door on a leash.</td>

When Ryan was home for Easter he talked to my husband and me and requested we get somebody to watch Amy at his college graduation. We said we would think about it and have been unable to make a decision. On one hand, Amy can be very difficult to handle in crowds and has a hard time empathizing with others and giving them the attention they might want or need. There are also only two tickets for handicap accessible seating, which means my family would not be able to sit together during the ceremony. Ryan was 6 when Amy was born and he has always been loving and compassionate toward her, so I think this stems from a desire to have this event be about him, not about all the logistics that surround a handicapped person. On the other hand, I am afraid that this will set a terrible precedent. What other events will Amy be excluded from, weddings, funerals, our 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; wedding anniversary party?

      <td>My family and my sister’s family are planning a beach house vacation this summer. We have two other siblings whom we would prefer not to invite. Our two families have vacationed together in the past, so this would not be unprecedented, but in the past we invited the siblings to drop in for one or two days, rather than the whole stay, so that they feel included. This summer we’d rather just keep things simple, but we are not sure how to best handle the situation. We don’t intend to publicize that we are going without the sibs, but after the fact there will certainly be photos or other evidence that the trip took place, and feelings might be hurt. Is there any graceful way to handle the situation that doesn’t involve inviting the sibs? If we choose not to invite them, does that make us bad siblings?&lt;br&gt;</td>

      <td>I am a kind, considerate person, and generally have a very happy disposition. I also suffer from what it is known as “bitchy resting face.” It’s pretty bad. I look either very unhappy, or downright evil, depending on one’s interpretation. Friends have had to assure other people that I won’t bite their heads off if approached! My husband is in the military, so every few years I have to start over from scratch with my social life, and it isn’t easy when I look so unapproachable. What can I do? I can’t walk around with a big, fake smile plastered on my face. It’s exhausting and I’d probably look a little looney!</td>

      <td>I’m a 30-year-old, Asian American, hetero-flexible cis woman. I’m also newly diagnosed with bipolar II. I’m on medication—the doctor is trying to figure that out—but no talk therapy for right now, as my last therapist wasn’t great and I haven’t managed to find a new one. My question for you is regarding the relationship between bipolar and kink. One of the common symptoms of the manic stage of bipolar is “risky sex.” I equate risk with “likely to blow up one’s personal or professional life” and have always answered “no” to that question when asked by doctors. I’ve had the occasional hookup, but otherwise I’ve consistently had sex in the context of closed, monogamous relationships, i.e., the opposite of risky sex. However, it recently occurred to me that I’m fairly kinky (BDSM, role-play). Nothing I’d consider a varsity-level kink, but what do I know? I have out-there fantasies that are varsity level, but I’ve never done them. Am I just bipolar and kinky? Are the two related somehow? Should I be concerned that I’ll go into a manic state and start enacting (or trying to enact) some of the varsity-level fantasies in my head?</td>

      <td>I’m a mostly gay male with a boyfriend who is also mostly gay. We are into BDSM—we are both tops and sometimes play with other sub men. I say we are “mostly” gay because we do like to fuck/top submissive women once in a while. We haven’t done this a lot, and never together because we don’t have the same taste in women—until recently. One of our new neighbors, a straight female, is very shy, but she’s opened up to us about her interest in BDSM. We took her to a play party, and she was okay watching others play, but any time anyone expressed an interest in her, she clammed up and withdrew. She stayed at our side the entire time. We are interested in propositioning her. Our dilemma is in how to approach someone so gun-shy. We want to seduce her into the experience and not make her uncomfortable, but we can’t agree as to how to go about it. Another issue is that we think the reason she has been so open with us is because she assumes we are both 100 percent gay.</td>

Unfortunately, she is not getting better. My own health is declining and I love her, but the subject of euthanizing her has come up at home and briefly in the vet’s office. Is this wrong?

I went out on a first date last week and the woman said to me that if a guy doesn’t lavish a woman with expensive dinners, gifts, vacations, etc., he’s just showing her how cheap he is. Throughout the meal she was trying to subtly determine my income. She also let me know that she’d never date a guy who didn’t drive a Mercedes, Audi, Cadillac, or comparable car. I’m not going out with her again, but she seemed to be digging for gold big time.
