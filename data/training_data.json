[{"question": "I expect I’ll get reamed for this, but here it goes. For context, I am Gen X and consider myself substantially liberal. However, I find myself more than annoyed as every rude characteristic has now become a diagnosed disability. Time blindness with today’s technology and custom notifications going off every other minute, come on, I totally get, neurodivergence is a thing. I’m enmeshed in the autistic community and ADHD, anxiety and other mental illness are abundant. But must we make allowances for every misbehavior? I understand showing grace for those who truly cannot help themselves. But what about my right to not be insulted, not be stood up, or not have more work thrust upon me because of someone’s executive function disorder? I can’t help feeling how I feel. So, I guess my question is how do I get past these feelings? I hate feeling so ungenerous, but I also don’t want to walk on eggshells because I made a joke about the weather and someone is now having a meltdown. How should I reframe this to just let it go?", "answer": ""},
  {"question":"My boyfriend and I are both 31, nearly 32. When we got together we fell in love very quickly and he asked for my ring size about five weeks in—I said from day one I wanted to be married. We moved in together at seven months (just before the pandemic) and have been very happy together in our little one-bedroom flat since. He is very close with his family and I have no family at all and have always wanted a family to call my own (note: I don’t really want children, but I would like for my husband and myself to be a unit). Every time I bring up marriage he says, “It will happen” and he has a plan, but it has been nearly over three years now. I don’t care about a fancy ring or anything—he could spend $10 for all I care but we talked proposals very early on and I said I would like to be proposed to and he agreed. Should I push again in a few months, or just say I’ve had enough if he clearly isn’t going to commit?", "answer":"Hang tight. Not all hope is gone. Its great that it seems like you all have similar values and goals, however, the conversation now looks a little different because your timelines might be off. There is nothing wrong with this, I just encourage you to have this conversation again. Ask each other challenging questions like: When do you want to be engaged? Financially, where does he stand on buying a ring? Where does your relationship truly stand (are there notable differences/problems)? These questions will help get the conversation started, rather than coming from the place of “pushing” him. The latter approach will sometimes delay what you ideally want, and, depending on the type of partner, may make him retreat. I ultimately think that if you two are still very happy and in love, a conversation where you’re both transparent about your feelings won’t change that. Try to remain in a realistic mindset for what makes sense for you both emotionally, financially, etc. If it seems to be a direct no on his end, then take that as a sign. It’s not a crime to want a partner whose on the same page as you and has similar goals in life. But also, I encourage you to look inward at your motivations for wanting to get married on your current timeline, and whether that is coming from any external forces. I wish you two the absolute best!"} ]
