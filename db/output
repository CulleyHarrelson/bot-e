The data associated with each field will be a number between 10\\n\nand 50 where you rate the request message as if you were assessing the\\n\npersonality of the author.\\n\n    \\n\n3. The 'demographics' field name will be assigned to a dictionary where the\\n\nfield names are drawn from the following list: age, gender, ethnicity_race,\\n\nmarital_status, education_level, occupation, income, geographic_location,\\n\nfamily_size, household_composition, religion, language, nationality,\\n\nsexual_orientation, disability_status, health_information, household_income,\\n\nhomeownership_rental, veteran_status, number_of_children.

The\\n\ndictionary should have the researcher names as keys, and you should select the\\n\nmost appropriate item from the list of values corresponding to each\\n\nresearcher's scale based on your assessment of the authors ego development.\\n\n"
