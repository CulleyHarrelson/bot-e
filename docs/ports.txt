  =========== BACKUP YOUR DATA! =============
  As always, backup your data before
  upgrading. If the upgrade leads to a higher
  major revision (e.g. 9.6 -> 10), a dump
  and restore of all databases is
  required. This is *NOT* done by the port!
  See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html
  ===========================================
For procedural languages and postgresql functions, please note that
you might have to update them when updating the server.

If you have many tables and many clients running, consider raising
kern.maxfiles using sysctl(8), or reconfigure your kernel
appropriately.

The port is set up to use autovacuum for new databases, but you might
also want to vacuum and perhaps backup your database regularly. There
is a periodic script, /usr/local/etc/periodic/daily/502.pgsql, that
you may find useful. You can use it to backup and perform vacuum on all
databases nightly. Per default, it performs `vacuum analyze'. See the
script for instructions. For autovacuum settings, please review
~postgres/data/postgresql.conf.

If you plan to access your PostgreSQL server using ODBC, please
consider running the SQL script /usr/local/share/postgresql/odbc.sql
to get the functions required for ODBC compliance.

Please note that if you use the rc script,
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/postgresql, to initialize the database, unicode
(UTF-8) will be used to store character data by default.  Set
postgresql_initdb_flags or use login.conf settings described below to
alter this behaviour. See the start rc script for more info.

To set limits, environment stuff like locale and collation and other
things, you can set up a class in /etc/login.conf before initializing
the database. Add something similar to this to /etc/login.conf:
---
postgres:\
	:lang=en_US.UTF-8:\
	:setenv=LC_COLLATE=C:\
	:tc=default:
---
and run `cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf'.
Then add 'postgresql_class="postgres"' to /etc/rc.conf.

======================================================================

To initialize the database, run

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/postgresql initdb

You can then start PostgreSQL by running:

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/postgresql start

For postmaster settings, see ~postgres/data/postgresql.conf

NB. FreeBSD's PostgreSQL port logs to syslog by default
    See ~postgres/data/postgresql.conf for more info

NB. If you're not using a checksumming filesystem like ZFS, you might
    wish to enable data checksumming. It can be enabled during
    the initdb phase, by adding the "--data-checksums" flag to
    the postgresql_initdb_flags rcvar. Otherwise you can enable it later by
    pg_checksums.  Check the initdb(1) manpage for more info
    and make sure you understand the performance implications.

======================================================================

To run PostgreSQL at startup, add
'postgresql_enable="YES"' to /etc/rc.conf

===> SECURITY REPORT:
      This port has installed the following files which may act as network
      servers and may therefore pose a remote security risk to the system.
/usr/local/bin/postgres

      If there are vulnerabilities in these programs there may be a security
      risk to the system. FreeBSD makes no guarantee about the security of
      ports included in the Ports Collection. Please type 'make deinstall'
      to deinstall the port if this is a concern.

Message from nginx-1.24.0_6,3:

--
Recent version of the NGINX introduces dynamic modules support.  In
FreeBSD ports tree this feature was enabled by default with the DSO
knob.  Several vendor's and third-party modules have been converted
to dynamic modules.  Unset the DSO knob builds an NGINX without
dynamic modules support.

To load a module at runtime, include the new `load_module'
directive in the main context, specifying the path to the shared
object file for the module, enclosed in quotation marks.  When you
reload the configuration or restart NGINX, the module is loaded in.
It is possible to specify a path relative to the source directory,
or a full path, please see
https://www.nginx.com/blog/dynamic-modules-nginx-1-9-11/ and
http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#load_module for
details.

Default path for the NGINX dynamic modules is

/usr/local/libexec/nginx.




Message from py39-certbot-2.6.0,1:

--
This port installs the "standalone" client only, which does not use and
is not the certbot-auto bootstrap/wrapper script.

The simplest form of usage to obtain certificates is:

 # sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d <domain>, [domain2, ... domainN]>

NOTE:

The client requires the ability to bind on TCP port 80 or 443 (depending
on the --preferred-challenges option used). If a server is running on that
port, it will need to be temporarily stopped so that the standalone server
can listen on that port to complete the challenge authentication process.

For more information on the 'standalone' mode, see:

  https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#standalone

The certbot plugins to support apache and nginx certificate installation
will be made available in the following ports:

 * Apache plugin: security/py-certbot-apache
 * Nginx plugin: security/py-certbot-nginx

In order to automatically renew the certificates, add this line to
/etc/periodic.conf:

    weekly_certbot_enable="YES"

More config details in the certbot periodic script:

    /usr/local/etc/periodic/weekly/500.certbot-3.9
