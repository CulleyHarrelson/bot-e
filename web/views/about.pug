      h5.cell History of Advice Columns
      p.cell
        | Bot-E is formatted in the style of newspaper advice column. With
        | traditional newspaper advice columns, readers of the column write the
        | newspaper a letter/email and someone from the newspaper responds. This
        | is often the host of a column, but it might be members of the newspaper
        | staff. Typically, readers' identities remain confidential. They might
        | use a pseudonym or just a first name. In some columns, the columnist
        | might assign a humorous or relevant pseudonym based on the content of
        | the letter.  After publication, readers often have the ability to
        | weight in, either through letters to the editor or online comments.   
      p.cell
        | Columnists had a responsibility to provide advice that was ethical and
        | not harmful. Misguided advice could have real-world consequences for
        | readers. Columnists often remind readers that while they offer
        | guidance, they are not a substitute for professional help, especially
        | for serious issues.
      p.cell
        | With the internet, many advice columns have transitioned to online
        | platforms. Some also host podcasts or video series. While traditional
        | advice columns covered a broad range of topics, some modern columns focus
        | on specific niches, such as workplace dilemmas, cultural issues, or
        | specific demographics.

        | Bot-E has a similar model. Powered by generative AI and prompt
        | engineering, Bot-E provides a mobile-first free chat with nearly instantenous
        | response times from a variety of personas.  These responses are moderated
        | using output from the openAI moderation API.

        | (flashcardexchange.com, now cram.com) Culley took the time to earn a
        | PhD in Clinical Psychology. He is now working full time on Bot-E.
