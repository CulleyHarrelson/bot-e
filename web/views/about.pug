      h5.cell History of Advice Columns
      p.cell
        | Bot-E represents the evolution of the classic newspaper advice column. 
        | With traditional newspaper advice columns, readers of the column write the newspaper a
        | letter/email and someone from the newspaper responds. This is
        | often the host of a column, but it might be members of the newspaper
        | staff. Typically, readers' identities remain confidential. They might use a
        | pseudonym or just a first name. In some columns, the columnist might
        | assign a humorous or relevant pseudonym based on the content of the
        | letter.  After publication, readers often have the ability to weight
        | in, either through letters to the editor or online comments.   
      p.cell
        | Columnists have a responsibility to provide advice that is ethical and
        | not harmful. Misguided advice can have real-world consequences for
        | readers. Columnists often remind readers that while they offer
        | guidance, they are not a substitute for professional help, especially
        | for serious issues.
      p.cell
        | With the internet, many advice columns have transitioned to online
        | platforms. Some also host podcasts or video series. While traditional
        | advice columns covered a broad range of topics, some modern columns focus
        | on specific niches, such as workplace dilemmas, cultural issues, or
        | specific demographics.
